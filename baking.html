    <p>As previously mentioned, one of my favorite desserts to bake is strawberry shortcake cupcakes. Although I do not
        like fruit in my dessert, or even like strawberries much, these cupcakes always turn out delicious and are so fun
        to bake! These are fully homemade: vanilla bean cupcakes, with strawberry filling and sweet strawberry whipped cream 
        on top. As a novice baker, I find them easy to bake and the recipe is simple to follow!

        Below is a <b>simplified version</b> of the recipe:
    </p>

    
    <ol class = "border">
        <li>Make the strawberry filling first by mixing:
            <ul>
                <li>diced strawberries</li>
                <li>lemon zest</li>
                <li>sugar</li>
                <li>cornstarch</li>
                <li>water</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make the cupcake batter by combining:
            <ul>
                <li>flour</li>
                <li>baking powder <i>and</i> baking soda</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>butter</li>
                <li>egg whites</li>
                <li>sugar</li>
                <li>sour cream</li>
                <li>milk</li>
                <li>vanilla bean paste or extract</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bake batter at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20-22 minutes</li>
        <li>Once cupcakes are baked and cooled, hollow out a small pocket in each cupcake, and fill with strawberry filling</li>
        <li>Make the whipped cream by mixing together:
            <ul>
                <li>heavy cream</li>
                <li>sugar</li>
                <li>vanilla bean paste/extract</li>
                <li>strawberry filling</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ice the cupcakes using the whipped cream</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>One helpful tip is to make sure the cupcakes are well cooled before hollowing them out to be filled. This will ensure 
        that your cupcakes do not fall apart when trying to hollow. Additionally, the piece of the cupcake that was carved out of 
        the full cupcake can be cut in half, then place back into the hole to provide a flatter and more solid foundation for the 
        whipped cream to be piped onto.
