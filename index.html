    <p>My name is Olivia Yeung. I am currently a second year student studying Data Science and Business Administration, with a minor in Mathematics.</p>
    
    <p>I enjoy singing and music a lot. I have been to concerts for 5 different artists. I have seen 5 Seconds of Summer perform twice, and TXT perform 3 times!
        One of the reasons that I love music is because I find it very creatively rewarding to be able to dissect your favorite songs to find unique patterns in
        the melodies. I also really love being able to relate to the lyrics and storytelling of different songs.
    </p>
    
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading. My favorite books are <i>Pride & Prejudice</i> by Jane Austen and <i>The Poppy War</i> trilogy by  R.F. Kuang. 
        I enjoy reading historical fiction and fantasy novels because I like how detailed the world-building is and how with both genres, you can immerse yourself
        in a different world.
    </p>
    
    <p>Another one of my favorite hobbies is baking. My favorite treats to bake are fudge brownies and strawberry shortcake cupcakes. One of the reasons that I love baking 
        is because I find it very therapeutic to be able to combine so many ingredients, utilize different techniques, and end up with a tangible (and yummy!) final product. 
        I think baking is systematic and deductive in the same way that coding is because you can try so many different methods to achieve the best and most efficient results. 
        For example, in baking, you can try so many different recipes for the same treat, or try many different techniques for a single step of one recipe. 
        In this way, baking is extremely fun to me.
